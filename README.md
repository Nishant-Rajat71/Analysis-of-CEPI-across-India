**ðŸ“Š Analysis of Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) Scores of India**

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project analyzes the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) scores of Indian industrial clusters using Python, Power BI, and Data Visualization techniques.
The CEPI index, developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), is a composite measure of air, water, and land pollution in industrial regions.

Scores â‰¥70 â†’ Critically Polluted (moratorium imposed).
Scores 60â€“70 â†’ Severely Polluted.
Scores <60 â†’ Under Observation.

The goal of this project is to:

Compare CEPI scores across years (2020â€“2022).
Identify the most and least polluted clusters.
Study the impact of moratorium status (In Force vs Lifted).
Perform state-wise pollution analysis.
Visualize data through interactive dashboards.
